    <h2>ðŸ§ª How the AI Model Works</h2>
    <p>
        This app uses a deep learning model based on the <strong>VGG16 architecture</strong>, fine-tuned to classify
        common retinal diseases and recognize uncertain or out-of-distribution images.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>1. Image Preprocessing:</strong> Uploaded images are resized to <code>224x224</code> pixels and
            normalized to match training conditions.
        </li>
        <li><strong>2. Feature Extraction:</strong> The VGG16 base captures fine-grained features from retinal
            scansâ€”like vessel shape, texture, or lesions.
        </li>
        <li><strong>3. Classification:</strong> A custom classification head predicts probabilities across five
            categories: <strong>Cataract, Diabetic Retinopathy, Glaucoma, Normal, and Unknown</strong>.
        </li>
        <li><strong>4. Output:</strong> The result with the highest confidence is displayed, including its probability
            score. If the model cannot confidently match the input to a known class, it predicts
            <strong>"Unknown"</strong>.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        This approach helps reduce misdiagnosis by flagging uncertain or outlier images instead of forcing a wrong
        prediction. However, predictions should always be verified by an eye care specialist.
