    <!-- Cataract -->
    <h3>1. üëÅÔ∏è Cataract</h3>
    <p>
        A cataract is the clouding of the eye's natural lens, which lies behind the iris and the pupil. It develops
        gradually and impairs vision over time. Most cataracts are age-related, but other causes include trauma, UV
        radiation, prolonged steroid use, or congenital conditions.

    </p>
    <div class="more-info" id="cataract-details" style="display: none;">
        <p><strong>Common Symptoms:</strong> Blurry vision, glare or halos around lights, faded colors, and difficulty
            seeing at night.</p>
        <p><strong>Prevention & Treatment:</strong> Wearing UV-protective eyewear can help slow cataract development.
            The only effective treatment is cataract surgery, which involves replacing the cloudy lens with an
            artificial intraocular lens (IOL).</p>

    <!-- Diabetic Retinopathy -->
    <h3>2. ü©∏ Diabetic Retinopathy</h3>
    <p>
        Diabetic Retinopathy is a complication of diabetes that affects the eyes. High blood sugar levels damage the
        tiny blood vessels in the retina, leading to leakage, swelling, and even closure of the vessels. <span

    </p>
    <div class="more-info" id="dr-details" style="display: none;">
        <p><strong>Common Symptoms:</strong> Floaters, blurred or fluctuating vision, dark spots, and vision loss in
            later stages.</p>
        <p><strong>Prevention & Treatment:</strong> Control blood sugar levels, regular retinal exams, laser therapy,
            anti-VEGF injections, or surgery if needed.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- Glaucoma -->
    <h3>3. üå´Ô∏è Glaucoma</h3>
    <p>
        Glaucoma is a group of eye diseases that damage the optic nerve, usually due to increased intraocular pressure
        (IOP). It's known as the "silent thief of sight" because it often causes no symptoms until irreversible damage
        has occurred. <span class="see-more-link" onclick="toggleDetails('glaucoma-details', this)">See More</span>
    </p>
    <div class="more-info" id="glaucoma-details" style="display: none;">
        <p><strong>Symptoms:</strong> Often none early on; later peripheral vision loss, tunnel vision, or sudden pain
            in acute cases.</p>
        <p><strong>Prevention & Treatment:</strong> Regular eye pressure checkups, eye drops, laser therapy, or surgery
            to prevent further nerve damage.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- Normal Retina -->
    <h3>4. ‚úÖ Normal Retina</h3>
    <p>
        A healthy retina shows no signs of vascular damage, hemorrhaging, swelling, or nerve degeneration. Maintaining
        eye health involves regular eye exams, especially for those with risk factors like diabetes or high blood
        pressure. <span class="see-more-link" onclick="toggleDetails('normal-details', this)">See More</span>
    </p>
    <div class="more-info" id="normal-details" style="display: none;">
        <p><strong>Tips for Eye Health:</strong> Eat leafy greens and omega-3 rich foods, manage screen time, avoid
            smoking, wear UV-blocking sunglasses, and get yearly eye exams.</p>

    <!-- Unknown -->
    <h3>5. ‚ùì Unknown</h3>
    <p>
        Sometimes the uploaded image doesn't clearly resemble any of the trained disease categories. This can happen due
        to poor image quality, lighting issues, or if the retina shows unfamiliar patterns not present in the training
        dataset.

    <div class="more-info" id="unknown-details" style="display: none;">
        <p><strong>What it means:</strong> The model is unsure or has low confidence in matching this image to a known
            disease class.</p>
        <p><strong>Suggestions:</strong> Make sure the image is a clear retinal scan. If you're certain the image is
            valid, consult a medical professional for further evaluation.</p>
